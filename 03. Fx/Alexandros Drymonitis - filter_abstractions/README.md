# filter_abstractions

This repository is meant to host various filter abstractions. For now there are two abstractions based on a combination of [filtercoeff.mmb~] and [biquad.mmb~] abstractions by Mike-Moser Booth, [multiFilter_abs~] and [omniFilter_abs~]. Hopefully it will grow.

Update December 2015: Eliminated the use of [expr~] in [omniFilter_abs~] and [multiFilter_abs~] abstractions.
