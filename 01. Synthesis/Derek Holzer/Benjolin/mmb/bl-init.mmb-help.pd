#X text 45 165 [bl-init.mmb] is an abstraction that contains precalculated
wavetables that are used by the [bl-*.mmb~] family of bandlimited oscillators.
It does not have to be explicity created \, however \, because all
the [bl-*.mmb~] oscillators check to see if there is an instance of
it on creation. If there isn't one \, then the oscillator will internally
dynamically patch one in. However \, if you delete the oscillator that
patched it in \, other [bl-*.mmb~] oscillators will stop producing
sound until you restart DSP. So \, if you're doing any live coding
or dynamic patching with these oscillators \, it might be a good idea
to explicitly create [bl-init.mmb] first (with no argument).;
#X text 44 364 The only time it is absolutely necessary to create this
object yourself is if you are working in a sample rate above 44100
Hz \, and you want the highest harmonic to extend past 22050 Hz (you
might not want this \, even at a higher samplerate). In this case \,
you can send a samplerate to [bl-init.mmb] \, and it will regenerate
the wavetables after a few minutes. NOTE: if you are working at a lower
sample rate \, you don't need to do this! The oscillators will not
generate harmonics above the Nyquist frequency (1/2 sample rate) of
whatever sample rate you are working with.;
