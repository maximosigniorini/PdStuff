This a library of general abstractions for PureData. Includes things like:

-Various filters and biquad coefficient generators.

-Bandlimited oscillators.

-Complex math operators.

-File browser (only tested on OSX, likely won't work on Windows).

-Mixer strips.

-A nice, flexible spectrogram.

-Interactive waveform display.

-State-saving/preset management stuff.

-Compressor and distortion effects.

...and a few other things.


I believe most of these are vanilla-friendly, but to use the entire library you will need Pd-extended 0.42.5 or later (haven't tested earlier versions).

Also, sorry for all the ".mmb"s added to the end of everything. I did that before I found out about namespaces and was just releasing individual abstractions here and there. And I've been too lazy to fix them all. ;-)
