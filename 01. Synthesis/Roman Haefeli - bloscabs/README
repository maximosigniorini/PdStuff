========

A set of band-limited waveform oscillator abstractions. Currently
there are:
 
 * band-limited saw
 * band-limited square
 * band-limited triangle

The band-limiting is achieved by the use of precomputed band-limited
wavetables. The wavetables are calculated at instantiation time of
such an abstraction. Those oscillators are very cheap in terms of CPU,
but require a certain amount of memory for storing the wavetables.


Known Issues
============

In order to save memory, many instances of the same abstraction use
the same set of wavetables. However, when the instance holding the
wavetables is deleted, the remaining instances don't work anymore due
to the lack of wavetables. Until Pd comes with some implementation of 
an [endbang], it's not easy to overcome that problem.
