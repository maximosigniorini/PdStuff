#X text 269 11 Because the way PD GEM deals with video the sound chanel
of the videos do not get played when we play a video file. To solve
this the ehu/ehu/video abstraction looks for a WAV sound file located
next to the video file we are importing. This file should contain the
sound chanel of the video (export it from your video editor). The sound
file must be named the same as the video but with .WAV extension. For
instance: whistle.mp4 and whistle.wav Please beware that playing around
with pitch might cause the sound to fail in sync with the video.;
