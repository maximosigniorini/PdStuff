This is the README file for Pd, a free real-time computer music software
package resembling Max.  You can get Pd for Linux, Mac OSX, or MS Windows,
from http://www.crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/software.html.  
Installation instructions are in the HTML DOCUMENTATION at:

    http://www.crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/Pd_documentation/index.htm

If you download and unpack Pd, you will also find the html documentation
locally in the file, .../pd-whatever/doc/1.manual/index.htm.  To unpack Pd:

LINUX (or freeBSD).  In some linux installations you can download Pd via
"apt-get install puredata" or "yum install puredata"; otherwise you will have to
download the source and compile it as described in the file, INSTALL.txt

Microsoft Windows.  Pd binaries are distributed as a "zip" file.   Unzip this,
creating a directory such as \pd.

Macintosh.  The web browser will automatically unpack the distributions
into a folder such as "pd-0.35" on your desktop.

If you have qustions about Pd, or if you wish to be notified of releases,
