from version 0.10 to version 0.11

- code refactorisation
- all messages name switch to singular for messages uniformisation
- add fonctionality to messages masses*L in order to add filter on masses Id (symbol only)
- same for links*L messages
- New messages linkEnd[1,2][X,Y,Z]T
- new messages to replace get messages : (should be almost compatible) : massPos [Id], massSpeed [Id], massForce [Id]
- new messages to replace get messages : linkPos [Id] gives the center of links, to be consistant with other linkPosL and linkPosT.
- new messages to replace get : linkEnd [Id] : should be compatible with get linksPos
- new messages testMass and testLink to get all masses or links that fit specifics conditions
- new messages testMassT and testLinkT (idem as testMass and testLink but with table)
- new messages testMassL and testLinkL (idem as testMass and testLink but with list)
- new messages massDistance Id Id : return message : massesDistance float_Id float_Id distance
- new messages setLCurrent Id [proportion] to change a link size depending on it's size and it's curent length
- new message : forceXT [Id] table (same in other dimention), to add a force to many masses, value come from the table.
- new message : setActive, setInactive for links
- new statistics messages for links
- new interactors messages
- new message "setEnd[1,2]" to change a link connection
- new message "overdamp" to amplifye forces that are opposed to movement
- message to change masses a link is connected to
- rename messages for consistency : [X,Y,Z]min/max -> min/max[X,Y,Z]
- rename message posX to setPosX
- debug "setL Id" with no arg : bad computation of link length (2d / 3d) 
- lot's of bugfix
- switch to makefile template 1.0.14
