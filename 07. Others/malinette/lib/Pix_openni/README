pix_openni (0.03 experimenting...)
======================================
pure data / Gem external to get Kinect rgb and depth streams, skeleton tracking, hand tracking

* depends on OpenNI, NITE, SensorKinect

2011/2012 by Matthias Kronlachner
__________________________________________________________

::INSTALL::
tested under Ubuntu and OSX 10.6.8, should run under Windows if you know how to compile it

OSX: 
you don't have to compile the external for yourself -> use included binaries from build folder (copy pix_openni.pd_darwin in pix_openni folder)
you still need OpenNI, NITE and SensorKinect!!
* 	download latest OpenNI and NITE unstable build for OSX from http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx, 
	sudo ./install.sh in the extracted folders
*	install SensorKinect from https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect


Linux:
*	get/install pd and Gem (http://puredata.info)

*	get and install OpenNI, NITE and the hacked Primesense Kinect driver
	--> instruction: https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect
	http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx

*	edit Makefile for right path to Gem, pd and OpenNI sources

*	#.../pix_openni> make

*	have a look at the pix_openni-help.pd file!

:: Usage ::

Hand Tracking:

to track multiple Hands edit following File: 
	/usr/etc/primesense/Hands_*/Nite.ini
and add or uncomment:

	[HandTrackerManager]
	AllowMultipleHands=1
	TrackAdditionalHands=1

Changelog


0.03	* switchable OSC Style output of tracking data /skeleton/joint/r_hand id x y z, /hand/coords id x y z
	* switchable real-world coordinate output in [mm]
	* switchable registration between rgb image and depth image -> change point of view from depth camera to match with rgb image (overlay)
	* improved help file

0.02
	* OSX binaries
	* output rgb and depth stream simultaneously
	* hand tracking
	* change image and depth modes
	* init without .xml init file
	* fixed depth to rgb conversion for output_mode 1 & 2


0.01
	* skeleton and rgb or depth stream output

 ________________
:::THINGS TO DO:::

*	record and play function for sensor data

*	support for multiple Kinect

*	motor and led control as well as audio is currently not supported from SensorKinect
	you can do that with pd external freenect: http://github.com/kronihias/freenect

*	clean shutdown of OpenNI framework -> currently you have to kill pd at least under linux

*	cpu performance optimization
