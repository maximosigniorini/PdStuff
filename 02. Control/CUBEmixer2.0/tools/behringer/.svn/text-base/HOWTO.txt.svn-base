HOW-TO get the programming of the BC[FR] from PC to the device??

a short report by IOhannes m zmölnig, iem, 2006



2 solutions come to my mind how to program the BC[FR]:


1. using BCEdit
===============
Programming the BC[FR]2000 with the BCEdit can be a real pain:
Usually you will get a "a Timeout Error while sending '$rev F1' 
in the application."

The good thing (when it works!) is, that you can dump the whole
device at once.

I think i remember that i once managed to dump the config-files
from the PC to the BC[FR]; alas!, i cannot remember how i did it...
(once i remember, i'll put it in here)

and i found this in the net:

if i only could speak dutch... but i thik the solution was to use
an older java-version (not verified)


2. using sysex dumps
====================
As an alternative you can always dump the configuration via sysex.
Unfortunately you can only dump 1 preset at a time, so if your 
setting has a lot of presets, this will considerably slow you down.

Anyhow, this is how to do it:
A0. copy the setting-file into "~/BCEdit/Devices" (if you don't the BCEdit
won't find it)
A1. Open BCEdit, select both on the left (hw) side and on the right (pc) side
the correct (and matching) device you want to program.
A2. Select the 'Device' (what a stupid name) you want to load on the right
(pc) side and 'Load' it into memory.
A3. Select the 'Preset' (middle field) you want to save
A4. Click on 'Export SysEx': an ugly file-dialog will pop-up
A5. browse to the directory of your liking and enter a Filename
in the very last field of the dialog (it says something about "filtername")
A6. CLICK on 'OK' to save the file. (just hitting return will NOT WORK)
A7. repeat from A3 till you have saved all presets you want to.
...(ok this was the first part, now lets dump it to the BC[FR]
B1. on the command-line run the command 
   "amidi -l" 
to list all available MIDI-devices and locate the BC[FR] you want to program.
(lets assume that you found it with the device-name "hw:3,0,0")
B2. on the BC[FR] select the preset to be set.
B3. now run the command 
   "amidi -p hw:<ID> -s <filename.syx>"
<filname.syx> is the filename of the sysex-dump
<ID> is the primary (numeric) ID of the device-name (so if the device-name
was "hw:3,0,0" then the <ID> is "3")
B4. you should see the 7seg-display on the BC[RF] dance around for a short
time (while the data is transmitted)
B5. now press the STORE-button on the BC[RF] 2 (two!) times (if you don't
do so, the dumped preset will be lost the next time you change the preset)
B6. repeat from B2 until all presets have been dumped and stored.

that's it! easy, isn't it??
